# Credit Score Analysis Tool

A microservices-based prototype platform built with Spring Boot to analyze and manage credit score data. The system demonstrates how enterprise-grade services communicate and 
integrate using modern backend technologies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is composed of multiple Spring Boot microservices communicating through REST APIs and routed using a Spring Cloud Gateway.

Main services included:

- Credit Scoring Service
- User Management Service
- Spring Cloud Gateway

The system simulates a credit score calculation and management platform with caching, messaging, and authentication mechanisms.

## 🧱 Architecture

### 1. CreditScoringServiceMS
Responsible for:
- Calculating credit scores
- Caching results using Redis
- Sending notifications using Kafka
- Logging and monitoring integrations

Technologies used:
- Spring Boot
- Redis Cache
- Apache Kafka
- Email notifications
- Log4j2 logging
- Splunk logging integration

---

### 2. UserManagementMS
Handles:
- User registration
- User login
- OAuth2 authentication
- Token validation

Technologies:
- Spring Security
- OAuth2
- JWT authentication
- REST APIs

---

### 3. SpringCloudGateway
Acts as an API gateway that:
- Routes requests to microservices
- Applies authentication filters
- Handles cross-origin requests

Technologies:
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Spring Security

---

## 🔄 Microservice Communication

Services communicate using REST APIs.  
For example, the credit scoring service consumes user data from the user management service to process credit scores.
